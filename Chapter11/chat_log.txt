User: What is data?
Assistant: Data refers to raw facts and figures that can be processed or analyzed to derive information. It can be in various forms, such as numbers, text, images, or sounds. Data is often structured (organized in a specific format, like databases) or unstructured (like emails or social media posts). 

In essence, data is the foundation for information, which is created when data is organized or interpreted in a meaningful way. It plays a crucial role in decision-making, research, and many technological applications.
